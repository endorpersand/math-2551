# 14.9: Taylor's Formula for $\large f(x, y)$
**Taylor Polynomial** (recap)
If function $f$ has $n$ derivatives at point where $x = a$, then the nth Taylor Polynomial for $f$ at $a$ is:
$$
\Large
P_n(x) = \sum\limits^n_{k = 0}{\frac{f^{(k)}(a)(x-a)^k}{k!}}
$$
**The theorem**
If $f$ has $n + 1$ derivatives on an open interval containing $a$, then for every $x$ in that open interval, we have:
$$
\Large
f(x)=P_n(x) + \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}
$$
for some (estimated) value $c$ between $a$ and $x$ that maximizes that term.

The absolute value of new term is called the error when using $P_n(x)$ to approximate $f(x)$.
$$
\Large
\text{error} = |f(x) - P_n(x)| = \frac{|f^{(n+1)}(c)|}{(n+1)!}|x-a|^{n+1}
$$

(I believe this was done in BC)

## Two Variables
Suppose $f(x, y)$ and its partials thru order $n+1$ are continuous throughout open rectangular region $R$ centered around $(a, b)$. Then, throughout R:
$$
\Large
f(a + h, b + k) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n+1}{\left.\frac{1}{i!}\left(h\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + k\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^{i}f\right|_{(a,b)}}
$$
Error term is the last one, last is also an approximate error term.

# 14.10: Partial Derivatives w/ Constraints
Steps
1. Decide which variables are dependent & independent
2. Eliminate the other dependent variables
3. Differentiate and solve

## Example
If $\Large w = x^2 + y - z + \sin(t)$ and $\Large x + y = t$, find $\Large \left(\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{y}}\right)_{z, t}$
(notation designates that $z, t$ are independent)

$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
x &= t - y\\
w &= (t - y)^2 + y - z + \sin(t)\\
\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{y}} &= -2(t-y) + 1
\end{align*}
$$
