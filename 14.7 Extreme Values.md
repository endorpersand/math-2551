# 14.7: Extreme Values
## Local Extrema
Let $f(x, y)$ be defined on a region $R$ containing point $(a, b)$. Then:
1. $f(a, b)$ is a **local maximum** of $f$ if $f(a,b) \geq f(x, y)$ for all domain points $(x, y)$ in an open disk around $(a, b)$.
2. $f(a, b)$ is a **local minimum** of $f$ if $f(a,b) \leq f(x, y)$ for all domain points $(x, y)$ in an open disk around $(a, b)$.

### First Derivative Test
If $f(x,y)$ has a local extremum at interior point $(a, b)$, then $\nabla f(a, b) = \vec{0}$ (all the partial derivatives are 0).
**Critical points**: The points where $\nabla f = \vec{0}$.
**Saddle point**: Critical point that isn't a local extremum (some points around greater, some are less)

### Second Partials Test 
This is analogous to the 2nd derivative test from single-variable calculus.

- Used to determine if a critical point is a saddle point or a local min or max
$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
A &= f_{xx}(x_0, y_0)\\
B &= f_{xy}(x_0, y_0)\\
C &= f_{yy}(x_0, y_0)\\
D &= \begin{vmatrix}
A & B\\
B & C
\end{vmatrix} = AC - B^2
\end{align*}
$$

1. If $D < 0$, $(x_0, y_0)$ is a saddle point.
2. If $D > 0$ and $A > 0$, local minimum.
3. If $D > 0$ and $A < 0$, local maximum.
4. If $D = 0$, test is inconclusive.

**Why?**
If $D > 0$, the surface is curving in the same way in all directions. Then, you can check $A$ or $C$ for if it is concave up ($A > 0$) or down ($A < 0$).

If $D < 0$, the surface is not curving in the same way in all directions. It must be a saddle point then.

## Absolute Extrema
**Absolute maximum**: Greatest value $f(x, y)$ for all $(x, y) \in D$
**Absolute maximum**: Smallest value $f(x, y)$ for all $(x, y) \in D$

Process for finding absolute extrema:

1. Find candidates:
	* [[14.1-2 Functions of Several Variables#Boundary Points and Interior Points|Interior points]] in $D$ that are critical points
	* [[14.1-2 Functions of Several Variables#Boundary Points and Interior Points|Boundary points]] in $D$ that are possible candidates (critical points and end points)
2. Evaluate $f$ at candidates.
3. Find lowest and highest of those.
