# 14.5: Directional Derivatives and the Gradient

## Directional Derivatives
$\Large f'_{\vec{u}}(x_0, y_0)$ or $\Large D_{\vec{u}}f(P_0)$ gives the **directional derivative** of $f$ in the direction of $\vec{u}$ at the point $P_0 = (x_0, y_0)$.
- The rate of change of $f$ in the $\vec{u}$ direction.

If $\Large \vec{u} = u_1\mathbf{i} + u_2\mathbf{j}$, then
$$
\Large
D_\vec{u}f(P_0) = \lim_{s \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + su_1, y_0 + su_2) - f(x_0, y_0)}{s}
$$
provided that the limit exists.

## Gradients
**Gradient** of a function $f(x, y)$ is vector
$$
\Large
\nabla f(x, y) = \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}}\mathbf{i} + \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}}\mathbf{j}
$$
You can imagine how to extend this into 3+ dimensions.

The gradient represents the direction and rate of fastest increase in $f$. (This is also stated below in the [[#Redefinition of Directional Derivative|redefinition of a directional derivative]].)

### Properties
$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
	\nabla(f(\vec{x}) + g(\vec{x})) &= \nabla f(\vec{x}) + \nabla g(\vec{x}) \\
	\nabla(\alpha f(\vec{x})) &= \alpha\nabla f(\vec{x}) \\
	\nabla(f(\vec{x})g(\vec{x})) &= f(\vec{x})\nabla g(\vec{x}) + \nabla f(\vec{x})g(\vec{x}) \\
\end{align*}
$$

### Redefinition of Directional Derivative
**Directional derivative** of $f$ in the direction of $\vec{u}$ at point $P_0 = (x_0, y_0)$ can be written as:
$$
\Large
f'_{\vec{u}}(P_0) = \nabla f(P_0) \cdot \hat{u} = \|\nabla f(P_0)\|\cos\theta
$$
where $\hat{u}$ is the unit vector in the $\vec{u}$ direction.

(Note that this is essentially a projection of the gradient onto $\hat{u}$.)

**Properties**
1. At $P_0$, function $f$ increases most rapidly in the direction of $\nabla f$.
2. Function $f$ decreases most rapidly in the direction of $-\nabla f$.
3. Any direction $\vec{u}$ orthogonal to gradient $\nabla f \neq 0$ is a direction of zero change in f.

### Examples
Find the gradient of $f(x, y) = 2e^x\sin(x^2+y)$
$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
\nabla f(x, y) &= (4xe^x\cos(x^2 + y)+2e^x\sin(x^2+y))\mathbf{i} \\
&\hspace{1em}+2e^x\cos(x^2 + y)\mathbf{j}\\
\end{align*}
$$

## Tangent Lines to Level Curves
The tangent line to level curve $f(x, y) = c$ at point $(x_0, y_0)$ is
$$
\Large
f_x(x_0, y_0)(x-x_0) + f_y(x_0, y_0)(y-y_0) = 0
$$

**Why?**
The equation for a tangent line is:
$$
\Large
y - y_0 = \left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{(x_0, y_0)}(x-x_0)
$$
[[14.3-4 Partial Derivatives#Implicit Differentiation again|The implicit differentiation rule]] can be applied here, so $\Large \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{f_x}{f_y}$.

Hence,
$$
\Large
y - y_0 = -\frac{f_x(x_0, y_0)}{f_y(x_0, y_0)}(x-x_0) = 0
$$
(which can be solved into the formula above)

## Derivative Along a Path
if $\vec{r}(t) = x(t)\mathbf{i} + y(t)\mathbf{j} + z(t)\mathbf{k}$ is a smooth path $C$ and $w = f(\vec{r}(t))$ is a scalar function evaluated along $C$, then the derivative along that path is
$$
\Large
\frac{d}{dt}f(\vec{r}(t)) = \nabla f(\vec{r}(t)) \cdot \vec{r}'(t)
$$

Note that this is equivalent to chain rule.
$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
\frac{df}{dt} &= \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}} \frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{z}} \frac{dz}{dt}\\
&= \left\langle\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}}, \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{y}}, \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{z}}\right\rangle \cdot \left\langle \frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}, \frac{dz}{dt}\right\rangle\\
&= \nabla f \cdot r'
\end{align*}
$$

## Gradient Orthogonality to Level Curves and Surfaces
Let point $P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ be on [[14.1-2 Functions of Several Variables#Level Curves and Surfaces|level surface]] $f(x, y, z) = c$.

Then, $\nabla f$ must be orthogonal to that level surface.

**Why?**
For all directions $\hat{u}$ tangent to the level surface, $f'_\hat{u}(P_0) = 0$ (the directional derivative in the direction $\hat{u}$ at point $P_0$ must be zero).
- Since $c$ is constant, traveling in the direction of the level surface will not change $f$, so the directional derivative is 0.

From [[#Redefinition of Directional Derivative|the properties of directional derivatives]], when $f'_\hat{u}(P_0) = 0$, $\nabla f$ must be orthogonal to $\hat{u}$.

So, $\nabla f$ must be orthogonal to every direction tangent to the level surface and thus must be normal to the level surface.
