# 14.10: Partial Derivatives w/ Constraints
Previous [[14.3-4 Partial Derivatives|partial derivatives]] assumed all variables were independent, but what if some of the variables have known relationships?

The notation $\Large \left(\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{y}}\right)_{z, t}$ represents the partial derivative of $w$ with respect to $y$, given that $z$ and $t$ are independent of $y$.

To evaluate a partial derivative with constraints:
1. Decide which variables are dependent & independent
2. Eliminate the other dependent variables
3. Differentiate and solve

## Example
If $\Large w = x^2 + y - z + \sin(t)$ and $\Large x + y = t$, find $\Large \left(\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{y}}\right)_{z, t}$

#### Method 1: Eliminating other independent variables first
Since $x + y = t$, substitute $x = t - y$ into $w$, resulting in:
$$
\Large
w = (t - y)^2 + y - z + \sin(t)
$$
All of the variables are now independent, so just compute the partial.
$$
\Large
\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{y}} = -2(t-y) + 1
$$

#### Method 2: Using chain rule
We know $x$ is dependent on $y$, so $\frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{y}}$ must be non-zero.
$$
\Large
\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{y}} = 2x \frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{y}} + 1
$$

Then, since $x = t - y$,
$$
\Large
\frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{y}} = -1
$$
Substitute $\frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{y}}$ and $x$, you get the answer from before.
