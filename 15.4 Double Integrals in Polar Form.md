# 15.4: Double Integrals in Polar Form
[[15.1-3 Double Integrals|Double integrals before]] were written in terms of $dx\,dy$, but they can be written in terms of $dr\,d\theta$, too.

Area of a polar region is based on the area of a sector of a circle.
- Area of a circle: $\pi r^2$
- Area of a sector: $\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\cdot\pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2}r^2\theta$

$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
\text{Area of polar region} &= \int_\alpha^\beta \frac{1}{2}r^2\,d\theta\\
&= \int_\alpha^\beta \int_a^b r\,dr\,d\theta\\
&= \iint_R r\,dr\,d\theta
\end{align*}
$$
(Note that $\int^b_a r\,dr = \left.\frac{1}{2}r^2\right|^b_a$)
$$
\Large
dA = r\,dr\,d\theta = dx\,dy
$$

Given $F(r, \theta)$ is continuous on $\Gamma: a \leq r \leq b, \alpha \leq \theta \leq \beta$:
$$
\Large
\iint_\Gamma F(r, \theta)r\,dr\,d\theta = \int_\alpha^\beta\int_a^b F(r, \theta)r\,dr\,d\theta
$$
Given $F(r, \theta)$ is continuous on $\Omega: \alpha \leq \theta \leq \beta, \rho_1(\theta) \leq r \leq \rho_2(\theta)$:
$$
\Large
\iint_\Omega F(r, \theta)r\,dr\,d\theta = \int_\alpha^\beta\int_{\rho_1(\theta)}^{\rho_2(\theta)} F(r, \theta)r\,dr\,d\theta
$$
Fubini's Theorem applies here. (Bounds can be switched or rearranged as described in Fubini's.)

## Volume

If $F(r, \theta) \geq 0$ over region $R$, then volume with $R$ as base, bounded above by $F(r, \theta)$ is:
$$
\Large
V = \iint_RF(r,\theta)r\,dr\,d\theta
$$
(same as double integrals above)
