# 12.5: Lines & Planes in Space
## Lines
The **vector equation** for line L through $P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ parallel to vector $\vec{v}$:
$$
\Large \vec{r}(t) = \overbrace{\vec{r}_{0}}^{P_0} + t\vec{v}
$$
The **standard parametrization** through $P_0(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ parallel to $\vec{v} = v_{1}\mathbf{i} + v_2\mathbf{j} + v_3\mathbf{k}$:
$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
x(t) = x_{0} + tv_{1}\\
y(t) = y_{0} + tv_{2}\\
z(t) = z_{0} + tv_{3}\\
\end{align*}
$$
For lines, $-\infty \leq t \leq \infty$.
For line segments, $t$ has proper bounds.

These forms will be the most common way lines will be seen in, but there is also the **symmetric form**:
$$
\Large
L: \frac{x - x_0}{v_1} = \frac{y - y_0}{v_2} = \frac{z - z_0}{v_1}
$$
**Why?**
From the standard parametrization, solve for t, set t equal. You get the symmetric form.

### Distance from point to line
To calculate the distance from a point to a line, pick a point $P$ on line $L$. Let $\vec{v}$ be the direction vector of $L$. Then:
$$
\Large
d = \frac{\left\|\overrightarrow{PS} \times \vec{v}\right\|}{\|\vec{v}\|}
$$

**Why?**
The distance we're trying to find is the magnitude of the vector perpendicular to line $L$ that reaches point $S$.

If we pick a point $P$ on the line $L$, and create vector $\overrightarrow{PS}$, then the distance is $\|\overrightarrow{PS}\|\sin\theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between $\overrightarrow{PS}$ and $L$. Note that the direction of $L$ is $\vec{v}$.

![[IMG_6691.jpg|300]]

Then:
$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
d &= \|\overrightarrow{PS}\|\sin\theta\\
&= \|\overrightarrow{PS}\|\sin\theta \cdot \frac{\|\vec{v}\|}{\|\vec{v}\|}\\
&= \frac{\|\overrightarrow{PS}\|\|\vec{v}\|\sin\theta}{\|\vec{v}\|}\\
&= \frac{\|\overrightarrow{PS} \times \vec{v}\|}{\|\vec{v}\|}
\end{align*}
$$
## Planes
The **vector equation** for a plane through $P_{0}(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0})$ with normal vector $\vec{n} = A\mathbf{i} + B\mathbf{j} + C\mathbf{k}$ is given by:
$$
\Large
\vec{n} \cdot (\overrightarrow{P_{0}P}) = 0
$$
Component equation: 
$$\Large A(x - x_{0}) + B(y - y_{0}) + C(z-z_{0}) = 0$$
### Angle between two planes
To calculate the angle between two planes, you calculate the **acute** angle between the two planes' normals.
$$
\Large
\cos \theta = \frac{|\vec{n}_{1}\cdot\vec{n}_{2}|}{\|\vec{n}_{1}\|\|\vec{n}_{2}\|}
$$
(Note the absolute bars in the numerator.)

### Distance from point to plane
To calculate the distance from a point to a line, pick a point on the plane, call it $P$. Let $\hat{n}$ be the **unit** vector that is normal to the plane. Then,
$$
\Large
d = \left\|\text{proj}_\hat{n}{\overrightarrow{PS}}\right\| = \overrightarrow{PS}\cdot\hat{n}
$$

## Intersecting lines & planes

### Lines
Lines $l_{1}, l_{2}$ can be...
- parallel
- intersecting
* coincident: same line
* skew: neither parallel nor intersecting

If the direction vectors are the same, the lines must be *parallel* or *concident*.
* Pick a point on $l_1$. If it is on $l_2$, the lines are coincident.
* Otherwise, the lines are parallel.

If the direction vectors are not the same, the lines must be skew or intersecting.
* Check if there are any intersecting points. If such a point exists, then the lines are intersecting.
* Otherwise, the lines are skew.

### Planes
Two planes can be: parallel, intersecting, coincident

* If the planes' normals are parallel, the planes are parallel
* If the planes' normals are not parallel, the [[12.4 Cross Products|cross product]] gives direction vector for line of intersection of the planes

### Line & Plane
To find the intersection point between a line and a plane, substitute the line equation into the plane equation.
If there's a valid point, then that is the intersecting point.

## Distance between lines

### Distance between parallel lines
To find the distance between two parallel lines $L_1$ and $L_2$, note that for any point on $L_2$, the distance to $L_1$ is the same.

Thus, pick any point $S$ on $L_2$ and apply the [[#Distance from point to line|distance from point to line formula]].
![[IMG_6692.jpg|300]]

### Distance between skew lines
To find the distance between two skew lines $L_1$ and $L_2$,
1. Let $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$ be the direction vectors of $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively.
2. Find the unit vector normal to $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$. This is $\Large \hat{n} = \frac{\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2}{\|\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2\|}$. (Remember that the cross product gives the vector normal to $v_1$ and $v_2$.)
3. Then, apply the [[#Distance from point to plane|distance from point to plane formula]]. (Pick points $P$ on $L_1$ and $S$ on $L_2$, and calculate $\Large d = \overrightarrow{PS} \cdot \hat{n}$.)

**Why?**
Imagine $L_1$ and $L_2$.
![[Pasted image 20220129131011.png|400]]

We can put $L_1$ and $L_2$ on two different planes that are parallel to each other ($P_1$ in red, $P_2$ in blue):
![[Pasted image 20220129131329.png|400]]

Since these planes are parallel, they must have the same normal. 
This normal must be perpendicular to the direction of $L_1$ ($\vec{v}_1$) and perpendicular to the direction of $L_2$ ($\vec{v}_2$), so the normal must be in the direction of $\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2$. 
So the **unit** normal vector is $\Large \hat{n} = \frac{\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2}{\|\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{v}_2\|}$. (The unit normal vector isn't necessarily needed but it makes calculations down the line easier.)

Note that because these planes are parallel, the distance between them are the same no matter which point we pick on $P_2$.

Thus, we can find the distance by projecting any line connecting the planes onto the normal.

So, we can pick a point on $P_1$ and $P_2$ and calculate the distance by projecting.
Of course, we do not know the equation for $P_1$ and $P_2$, but we know $L_1$ is on $P_1$ and $L_2$ is on $P_2$.

So, we can pick points on $L_1$ and $L_2$.
