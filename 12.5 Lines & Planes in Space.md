# 12.5: Lines & Planes in Space
## Lines
The **vector equation** for line L through $P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ parallel to vector $\vec{v}$:
$$
\Large \vec{r}(t) = \overbrace{\vec{r}_{0}}^{P_0} + t\vec{v} \hspace{0.5em} (-\infty < t < \infty)
$$
The **standard parametrization** through $P_0(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})$ parallel to $\vec{v} = v_{1}\mathbf{i} + v_2\mathbf{j} + v_3\mathbf{k}$:
$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
x(t) = x_{0} + tv_{1}\\
y(t) = y_{0} + tv_{2}\\
z(t) = z_{0} + tv_{3}\\
\end{align*}
$$
If is line, $-\infty < t < \infty$. If t is bounded, is line segment.

### Distance from point to line

$$
\Large
d = \frac{\left\|\overrightarrow{PS} \times \vec{v}\right\|}{\|\vec{v}\|}
$$

## Planes
The **vector equation** for a plane through $P_{0}(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0})$ with normal vector $\vec{n} = A\mathbf{i} + B\mathbf{j} + C\mathbf{k}$ is given by:
$$
\Large
\vec{n} \cdot (\overrightarrow{P_{0}P}) = 0
$$
Component equation: 
$$\Large A(x - x_{0}) + B(y - y_{0}) + C(z-z_{0}) = 0$$
### Angle between two planes
* Parallel planes have the same normal.
* Angle between two intersecting planes = acute angle between normals $\Large \left(\cos \theta =  \frac{|\vec{n}_{1}\cdot\vec{n}_{2}|}{\|\vec{n}_{1}\|\|\vec{n}_{2}\|}\right)$

### Distance from point to plane
![[Pasted image 20220114213751.png]]
$$
\Large
d = \left\|\text{proj}_\hat{n}{\overrightarrow{PS}}\right\| = \overrightarrow{PS} \cdot \overbrace{\hat{n}}^{\mathclap{\text{normalized } \vec{n}}}
$$

Use this to find **distance between skew lines**
* Given lines $l_1, l_2$, find unit normal vector of the $l_1l_2$ plane, $\Large \hat{n} = \frac{\vec{l_1} \times \vec{l_2}}{\| \vec{l_1} \times \vec{l_2}\|}$, and project $\overrightarrow{PS}$ onto $\hat{n}$
## Intersecting lines & planes

### Lines
Lines $l_{1}, l_{2}$ can be...
- parallel
- intersecting
* coincident: same line
* skew: neither parallel nor intersecting

If the direction vectors are the same, the lines must be *parallel* or *concident*.
* Pick a point on $l_1$. If it is on $l_2$, the lines are coincident.
* Otherwise, the lines are parallel.

If the direction vectors are not the same, the lines must be skew or intersecting.
* Check if there are any intersecting points. If such a point exists, then the lines are intersecting.
* Otherwise, the lines are skew.

### Planes
Two planes can be: parallel, intersecting, coincident

* If the planes' normals are parallel, the planes are parallel
* If the planes' normals are not parallel, the cross product gives direction vector for line of intersection of the planes

### Line & Plane
To find the intersection point between a line and a plane, substitute the line equation into the plane equation.
If there's a valid point, then that is the intersecting point.
