# MATH 2551 Notes
Heya! ðŸ‘‹

This is a directory of notes for MATH 2551 (Multivariable Calculus).
These are written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), so if you have Obsidian, you can just clone this repo and open the folder on Obsidian!

If you don't have Obsidian, ~~get it~~ you can check out the [/pdf](pdf/README) folder to read the markdown files as compiled PDFs.
