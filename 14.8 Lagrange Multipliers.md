# 14.8: Lagrange Multipliers
- Can be used to help solve optimization problems that have constraints

## Orthogonal Gradient Theorem
Suppose $f(x, y, z)$ is differentiable in region whose interior contains smooth curve:
$$
\Large
C: \vec{r}(t) = x(t)\mathbf{i} + y(t)\mathbf{j} + z(t)\mathbf{k}
$$

If $P_0$ is a point on $C$ where $f$ has a local extremum relative to its values on $C$, $\nabla f$ is orthogonal to $C$ at $P_0$.

**Why?**
$f$ is at a local extremum on $C$ when $\Large \frac{df}{dt} = 0$. 

For [[14.5 Directional Derivatives & Gradient#Derivative Along a Path|derivatives along a path]], $\Large \frac{df}{dt}= \nabla f \cdot \vec{r}'$.

As such, $\Large \nabla f \cdot \vec{r}' = 0$, so if $f$ is at a local extremum on $C$, $\nabla f$ must be orthogonal to the path of travel there.

## Method of Lagrange Multipliers
Suppose $f(x, y, z)$ and $g(x, y, z)$ are differentiable and $\nabla g \neq 0$ when $g(x, y, z) = 0$. To find local extremum of $f$ subject to $g(x, y, z) = 0$, find $x, y, z, \lambda$ satisfying:
$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
\nabla f &= \lambda \nabla g\\
g(x, y, z) &= 0
\end{align*}
$$

**Why?**
Let's say the point we're trying to find is $P_0 = (x, y, z)$, which meets the condition $g(x, y, z) = 0$ (note that this means $P_0$ is on a level surface).

If $P_0$ is a local extremum, then on every curve at $P_0$ on the level surface, it must be at a local extremum.

By the above [[#Orthogonal Gradient Theorem]], $\nabla f$ is orthogonal to the level surface.
Since [[14.5 Directional Derivatives & Gradient#Gradient Orthogonality to Level Curves and Surfaces|gradients are orthogonal to level surfaces]], $\nabla g$ is orthogonal to the level surface.

So $\nabla f$ must be a multiple of $\nabla g$, or in other words:
- If $\nabla f$ is at a local extremum and $g(x, y, z) = 0$, then there must be a constant $\lambda$ such that $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$.

## Example
Maximize $xy$ on ellipse $4x^2 + 9y^2 = 36$.
$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
f(x, y) &= xy\\
\nabla f(x, y) &= y\mathbf{i} + x\mathbf{j}\\\\
g(x, y) &= 4x^2 + 9y^2 - 36\\
\nabla g(x, y) &= 8x\mathbf{i} + 18y\mathbf{j}
\end{align*}
$$

Equations formed:
$$
\Large
\begin{align*}
y &= \lambda (8x)\\
x &= \lambda (18y)\\
4x^2 + 9y^2 - 36 &= 0
\end{align*}
$$
We get values for x and y. This gives us points we can use to maximize $xy$.
